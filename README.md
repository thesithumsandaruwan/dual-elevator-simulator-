# Dual Elevator Simulator

## Description
The Dual Elevator Simulator is a project that simulates the operation of two elevators in a ten-story building. The building has floors numbered from 1 (ground level) to 10 (top level), with each floor having buttons to request the elevator.

## Features
- Two elevators operating in a ten-story building.
- Ground and top levels have one button each for requesting the lift.
- Other floors have two buttons (up and down) to request the lift.
- Elevators respond to button signals from floors and passengers inside the lift.
- Elevators stop if a passenger wants to get off or if the lift is moving in the requested direction.
- If no requests are made, the elevators remain stationary.
- Each elevator has ten buttons to indicate the floors.
- Elevator doors remain open for 10 seconds to allow passengers to get on and off.
- Floor buttons light up when pressed and remain lit until the elevator reaches the destination.
- Simulation speed: 2 seconds of real-world time is simulated in 1 second in the application.
- Elevator takes 2 seconds to move between consecutive floors.
- Button status for all floors and inside the elevator is displayed in the application.
